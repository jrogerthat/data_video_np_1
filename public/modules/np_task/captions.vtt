00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.716
Jellystone is one of the busiest national parks in Tasmania.

00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:11.115
If you're planning a trip to Jellystone and prefer tent camping

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:15.333
the most popular time to visit is between February and March

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:23.602
when the average nightly temperature is between 32°F (above freezing) and 70°F.

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:29.275
The park experiences its highest tent camping activity during this time,

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.748
with approximately 140,000 nights spent in campgrounds at its peak.

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:41.209
You'll notice that RV camping nights remain well below that of campgrounds and lodges.

00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:48.000
That is because out of the 12 campgrounds in the park, only one has RV hookups available.

00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:56.000
Those brave enough to explore the Tasmanian backcountry will likely have a night under the stars to themselves.

00:00:56.296 --> 00:01:03.637
Backcountry camping is the least utilized, not quite reaching 5,000 nights at its peak of the season.

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:10.291
Jellystone has average temperatures that dip below freezing for a staggering 9 months.

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:17.003
Though the park is open year-round, most roads and facilities close from May to December,

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:22.238
limiting access to those of us who are not traveling by snowmobile or skis.

00:01:22.537 --> 00:01:29.393
We can see this in the visualization, with lodging being the only accommodation used during that time.

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:39.309
You will notice a small bump in overnight stays in August when people stay in the park to cross-country ski and snowshoe.
