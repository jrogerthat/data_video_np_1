On the left is a visualization of overnight stays at Crait National Park. 

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:11.333
Each concentric ring in the background represents 5,000 nights.

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:16.948
The colored rings represent the number of nights spent per month per accommodation type.

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.274
Each colored ring represents a type of accommodation:

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:25.055
lodging, RV, tent, and backcountry.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:31.807
From this, we can see tent camping is the most popular accommodation from October to May.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.089
The white part of the visualization indicates average temperatures below freezing (32°F).

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:46.977
The red shape in the circle represents average temperatures above 70°F.

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:52.906
From December to May, some nights average above 70°F.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:57.963
