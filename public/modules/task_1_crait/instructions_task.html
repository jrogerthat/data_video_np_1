<h2>Task 1 (Instructions)</h2>

<p>For task 1, you will 
  see <span id="condition_instruction_task_1"></span>
  for overnight stays in the fictional Crait National Park with instructions on how to read the visualization. 
  After you read the instructions and study the visualization, you will be asked a set of questions measuring your understanding of the visualization.
</p>
  <h4>Please read carefully:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Remember, you cannot go back or reload for the duration of this study.</strong></li>
    <li>You will have two minutes to <span id="condition_instruction_task_1_B"></span>. Please read and study the visualization carefully.</li>
    <li>If you do not remember the answer, <strong>please do not guess. </strong>Every question has an "I don't know" option.</li>
    <li>You will <strong>not</strong> have the visualization for reference when you answer these questions.</li>
  </ul>
