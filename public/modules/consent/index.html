    Are data videos better for communication to a wide audience? 
    This study seeks to better understand differences in insight and understanding between data videos and static visualizations regardless of prior visualization experience. 
  Should you choose to participate you will be asked to: 
  <ul>
      <li>Fill in relevant demographic information.</li>
      <li><span id="condition_instruction"></span></li>
      <li>Complete questions on engagement and congitive load during the task.</li>
      <li>Complete questions measuring spatial reasoning.</li>
      <li>Complete 12 questions to assess your visualization literacy.</li>
      <li>Provide any feedback you wish</li>
  </ul> 
   We expect the entire study to take about 26 minutes. You can find the full consent form below.

  There are no direct benefits or foreseeable risks to you for participating in this study. However, if you decide to take part, you will play an integral role in the development of future visualizations. Any information collected for this study will be entirely confidential. The questionnaires that you would be required to complete will only be identifiable by an assigned ID number, and will not be associated with your name or any personally identifiable information. 
  <br><br>
  <strong>Purpose of Study</strong><br>
  We aim to better understand how visualizations can be used to aid in reasoning problems. The result of this study would help in the improvement of future visualization designs. 
  <br><br>
  <strong>Task Description</strong><br>
  You will be shown a visualization and asked to answer questions about your understanding of the visualization. 
  Please try to respond as accurately as possible. In addition, you will be asked to complete a visualization literacy test, test of spatial reasoning and demographic questionnaire, and provide any additional feedback you wish.
