00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.440
There is a newly discovered disease, Disease X,&nbsp;
which is transmitted by a bacterial infection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.160
found in the population. There is a test to&nbsp;
detect whether or not a person has the disease,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.400
but it is not perfect. Here is some&nbsp;
information about the current research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.800
on Disease X and efforts to test&nbsp;
for the infection that causes it.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.840
There is a total of 100 people in the&nbsp;
population. Out of the 100 people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.200
the population, 6 people actually have&nbsp;
the disease. Out of these 6 people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.440
4 will receive a positive test result and 2 will&nbsp;
receive a negative test result. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.320
94 people do not have the disease (i.e., they&nbsp;
are perfectly healthy). Out of these 94 people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.200
16 will receive a positive test result and&nbsp;
78 will receive a negative test result.
