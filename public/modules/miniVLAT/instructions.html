    <h2>Visualization Literacy Assessment Test</h2>
    
    <p>To get a sense of your baseline visualization literacy, you will be given 12 multiple-choice questions.
        Answer to the best of your ability. If you are unsure,you may skip the questions instead of guessing.
        <strong>You will have 25 seconds to complete each question.</strong>
    </p>

      <!-- <h4>Please read carefully:</h4> -->
      <!-- <ul>
        <li>You will <strong>not</strong> have the visualization for reference when you answer these questions.</li>
        <li>You will have <span class="missing">[two minutes (but can decide if we want more)]</span> to study the visualization. Please read and study the visualization carefully.</li>
        <li>Once you move on to the multiple choice questions, <strong>you will not be able to go back or reload.</strong></li>
        <li>If you do not remember the answer, <strong>please do not guess. </strong>Every question has a "I do not recall" option.</li>
      </ul> -->
